<p><em>What are resources?</em></p>
<p>"A resource is anything that's important enough to be referenced as a thing in itself. Ifyour users might "want to create a hypertext link to it, make or refute assertions about it, retriev or cache a representation of it, include all or part of it" (Architecture), you should make it a resource." (Richardson, 2013)</p>
<p><em>What are representations and how are they transferred?</em></p>
<p>A representation is a descriptoion of the current state of a resource. It is transfered to the client via HTTP. The representation can be one of many formats. Some of them being JSON, HTML, XML, CVS, plain text, and more.</p>
<p><em>Which HTTP methods should you use and why?</em></p>
<p>The HTTP methods that we should use are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH.</p>
<p>"There's no official set of protocol semantics. We can have a lot of fun arguing over which HTTP methods are the best, but it really comes down to membership in a community. When you choose the HTTP methods you're going to use, you choose a community of clients and other componts that understand those methods." (Richardson, 2013)</p>
