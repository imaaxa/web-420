<p><em>How does a client application find and parse an entity-body?</em></p>
<p>When the &lt;form&gt; tag has "POST" as its method attribute, it describes an HTTP POST request that can do anything at all. The &lt;input&gt; tags are still present, but instead of being used to create the request URL, theyâ€™re used to create an entity-body with the media type application/x-www-form-urlencoded. The request URL is hard-coded in the action attribute of the &lt;form&gt; tag. (Richardson & Amundsen, p.111, 2013)</p>
<p><em>Explain what profiles are and how they are related to application semantics.</em></p>
<p>"A profile is defined not to alter the
   semantics of the resource representation itself, but to allow clients
   to learn about additional semantics (constraints, conventions,
   extensions) that are associated with the resource representation, in
   addition to those defined by the media type and possibly other
   mechanisms. (Wilde, 2013)"</p>
<p>There are three ways to link a document to its profile.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use an IANA link relation link. (&lt;link href="profile_url_here" rel="profile"&gt;)</li>
  <li>Add a profile link to the content-type header. (application/collection+json;profile="profile_url_here")</li>
  <li>Use the itemtype hypermedia control. (&lt;div itemtype="profile_url_here"&gt;)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What are application semantics?</em></p>
<p>Application semantics is how we, as developers, can try to link things in the application to items in the real world.</p>
<p><em>Using your own words, what does a machine-readable profile mean?</em></p>
<p>This is a profile that is written in a way that allows the computer to make the connections semanticly between what is there and what the data represents. This allows for a tighter compling between the physical and the virtural.</p>
