<p><em>What is SOAP?</em></p>
<p>"SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchange of information in a decentralized, distributed environment. It is an XML based protocol that consists of three parts: an envelope that defines a framework for describing what is in a message and how to process it, a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of application-defined datatypes, and a convention for representing remote procedure calls and responses. (w3.org, 2000)"</p>
<p><em>What is the relationship between SOAP and XML?</em></p>
<p>SOAP calls are wrapped in XML. The calls will consist of the envelope, an optional head, the body, and an optional footer.</p>
<p><em>Can SOAP be “RESTful” and if so, how or why?</em></p>
<p>SOAP can not be “RESTful”. The SOAP protocol does not match up with a REST architecture. A the core of the issue, REST is resource centric where SOAP is logic centric.</p>
