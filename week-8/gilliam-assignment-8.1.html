<p><em>Describe what “Cache-Control” is and how it is used.</em></p>
<p>"Cache-control is an HTTP header used to specify browser caching policies in both client requests and server responses. Policies include how a resource is cached, where it’s cached and its maximum age before expiring. (Imperva, 2018)"</p>
<p><em>List and describe the available options for managing security in a REST API.</em></p>
<p><em>Authentication</em><br><span style="margin-left: 30px;">A process where a user must provide proof that they have permission to access the system, either with local credentials or through a third party system.</span></p>
<p><em>Basic Auth</em><br><span style="margin-left: 30px;">Uses a simple Base64 encrypted username/password string in the header, under the Authorization key.</span></p>
<p><em>Digest</em><br><span style="margin-left: 30px;">Uses an MD5 encrypted hash of the username/password string in the header, under the Authorization key.</span></p>
<p><em>OAuth 1.0</em><br><span style="margin-left: 30px;">It is a third party system that allows access by the use of tokens instead of the users credentials.</span></p>
<p><em>OAuth 2.0</em><br><span style="margin-left: 30px;">Is simular to OAuth 1.0, but separation of resource delivery and authorization, and allows for multiple types of implementations. This means that it can be utalized by more types of applications, and not just web browsers.</span></p>
