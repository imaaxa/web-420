  <h1>Enterprise Service Bus: Web Services Meet Message - Oriented Middieware</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Enterprise service bus (ESB) is a new term for an old ideal. Generally. ESB refers to a universal middleware environment that supports simple, speedy, standards-based integration across heterogeneous network application environments. Some say the ESB ideal is well within our reach, due to the widespread adoption of Web services standards. Others say it's a pipe dream, and that it glosses over the stubbornly complex challenges of real-world integration. ESB is an architectural concept, but it's more than just a middleware field of dreams. It also refers to a growing segment of the integration software market that addresses the intersection of message-oriented middleware (MOM) and Web services. ESB vendors include both middleware providers—such as Fiorano Software, Iona. Polar- Lake. Sonic Software. Tibco Software and web- Methods—and platlbnTi vendors such as IBM, BHA. Oracle and Sun. ln addition. Microsoft will provide ESB capabilities in the Windows Communications Eoundation functionality of its forthcoming Windows Vista and "Longhom" operating environments, though Microsoft distances itself publicly from the term "ESB" (.see "Microsoft WCE: Looks. Walks And Quacks Like An HSB"). We're also seeing the rise of ESB open-source projects, including Apache Synapse. Celtix and ServiccMix. all of which leverage an emerging standard: Java Business Integration</p>
    <h2>ESB: Why Network Managers Should Care</h2>
    <p>From a network manager's point of view. ESB products will grow in importance, as platforms for shaping and controlling traffic Hows at the application layer become more important. ESB environments provide more content-aware trafficrouting flexibility than traditional hub-and-spoke middleware environments. But the flip side of that benefit is the potential for more unpredictable. peer-to-peer traffic flows among ESB enabled application servers and other endpoints. In spite of this potential for greater complexity of traffic flows, ESB's core value proposition, visa- vis traditional middleware approaches, is the simplification, through additional abstraction, of enterprise software and application integration. ESB products provide an abstraction layer that mediates among old and new computing platforms and middleware environments. An ESB environment offers simplification along several dimensions:</p>
    <h2>Unified integration paradigm:</h2>
    <p>LSB products wrap, virtualize and integrate the legacy integration paradigms—such as MOMs. object request brokers (ORBs) and remote procedure calls (RPCs)—within the new paradigms of Web services and service-oriented architecture (SOA— also see this issue, pp. 10-11). Web services refers to a middleware environment—but not the only one—that may integrate across an ESB. SOA refers to a development paradigm that encourages maximum reuse and sharing of functionality across networked platforms, such as through Web services protocols over an ESB.</p>
    <h2>Modular integration layers:</h2>
    <p>ESB products allow Implementation of as few or as many robust integration services—such as reliable messaging, event notification, publish-and-subscribe, content transformation and orchestration—as appropriate to a particular integration scenario. ESB architectures are modular at all layers, and vendors often package ESB functionality as separate software components that may be deployed in various combinations to address the diverse integration requirements of enterprises and service providers.</p>
    <h2>Flexible integration patterns:</h2>
    <p>As noted above, ESB products support flexible messaging patterns, including hub-and-spoke, routed and peer-to-peer message flows, within the same integration environment. They support the requestresponse conversational flows associated with SOA, the publish/subscribe flows associated with event-driven architecture, and the method-invocation flows associated with object-invocation environments. And they allow integration architects to implement communication alternatives sucb as static vs. dynamic object binding; synchronous vs. asynchronous connections; stateless vs. stateful conversations; transacted vs. non transacted sessions, and reliable vs. best-effort messaging.</p>
    <h2>Ubiquitous integration-logic deployment:</h2>
    <p>ESB products usually allow integration coinponents to be deployed at many points in a distributed environment, including endpoints (sucb as application servers), distributed intermediary nodes (such as content-based routers. WSM agents, message brokers, queue managers, proxy servers) and centralized integration hubs (such as integration brokers and protocol gateways). Often, ESB vendors build their components to be scaled. clustered and failed over, and to provide the ability to monitor and manage integration components remotely from a central console.</p>
    <h2>Visual integration models:</h2>
    <p>ESB products provide a visual, intuitive, model-driven inteiface for development, integration, orchestration, monitoring and management of complex environments.</p>
    <h2>Core ESB Architecture, Functionality And Standards</h2>
    <p>But when delving into ESB ollerings, let the buyer beware. "ESB" is a trendy marketing buzz phrase that every middleware vendor interprets to its own advantage (see "ESB: A Few Quick Definitions of a Sprawling Abstraction," p. 33). Increasingly, we're seeing "ESB" used in the brand names of vendors" integration products, such as BEA AquaLogic Service Bus, CapeClear ESB for WebSphere, Fiorano ESB 2006. IBM WebSphere Enterprise Ser\ice Bus. Oracle Enterprise Service Bus, Sonic ESB and Sun Java ESB Suite. These and other middleware vendors are also using the tenii as a catch-all for the re-branding of their entire product portfolios, spanning both legacy and future offerings. Vendors often label older middleware approaches—sucb as MOM, enterprise application integration (EAI). business process management (BPM), object request brokers (ORBs). remote procedure calls (RPCs) and integration brokers—as components or facets of ESB. Against this spin-intensive backdrop, it can be difficult to compare and contrast different vendors" ESB offerings on a feature-by-fcature basis. Nevenheless. some architectural and functional commonalities pervade the ESB market. Most ESB products support reliable messaging, event notification and publish-and-subscrihe (the traditional MOM features). ESB products leverage Web services standards and interface with established reliable-messaging MOM  protocols such as IBM WebSphere MQ, Tibco Rendezvous and Sonic Software's SonicMQ. Common features of ESB products include the ability to bridge heterogeneous MOMs, wrap MOM protocols with Web Services Description Language (WSDL) interfaces, and tunnel Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) tt affic over MOM transports. Many ESB products also suppotl Web Services Reliable Messaging (WS-RM) and WSNotification. which are widely-adopted industry specifications that enable MOM-like features over native SOAP and HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) transports. But ESB is much more than "super-MOM." Many ESB solutions also support such critical integration functions as ACID (atomic, consistent, independent, durable) transactions, data transformation, content-based routing, policy-based orchestration, business process management (BPM). business activity monitoring (BAM) and Web Services management (WSM). (For a discussion of WSM, see "New Tools for Web Services Management" in the April 2004 issue of BCR.) Architecturally, one of the halltnarks of tnost ESB solutions is messaging centric integration, which embraces and interfaces older, proprietary MOMs with the emerging wodd of SOAP-based Web services. In addition, ESB environments arc often distinguished from legacy middlewate approaches by their superior architectural flexibility, supporting diverse multipoint messaging flows such as hub-and-spoke, decentralized and peer-lopeer with equal agility. By contrast, legacy MOMs primarily support peer-to-peer messaging patterns, while traditional integration brokers—such as Micro.soft BizTalk Server—focus on hub andspoke integration. Figure 1, p, 34 shows an ESB application-messaging environment's suppoit for flexible messaging patterns, including hub-and-spoke, routed and peer-to-peer (as well as for complex interactions among those pattems).</p>
    <h2>ESB Vendors Converge From Different Competitive Backgrounds</h2>
    <p>Vendors are converging on ESB tVotii different middleware market niches. Differentiation and positioning strategies follow several tracks. Traditional MOM vendors are positioning their message brokering/queueing offerings as ESB in order to defend their market positions. In particular, IBM, Tibco and Sonic have strong, diversified ESB product portfolios and development road maps. Over the long term, smaller ESB/MOM vendors—such as Fiorano—will find it increasingly difficult to position themselves as viable alternatives to these entrenched competitors. Just supporting WS-* and peer-to-peer messaging may not be enough to distinguish smaller MOM vendors in the ESB market, no matter how stable or reliable their products might be. Integration broker vendors recognize that ESB's superior messaging flexibility will erode their considerable share of the middleware market. Some integration broker vendors—such as Cape Clear and webMethods—have added flexible ESB mes.saging pattems to products that have traditionally supported hub-and-spoke integration. However, other integration-broker vendors—such as Fuego, Intalio, Eombardi Software, Savvion, Seagull Software and Ultimus—haven't indicated when or whether they'll integrate decentralized or peer-to-peer messaging into their product architectures. Traditional ORB vendors have largely migrated towatd the ESB model. Iona—one of the bestknown ORB vendors—has made this transition effectively. With its Artix FSB product architecture. Iona is migrating customers' peer-topcer ORB environments (Iona"s Orbix technology) toward native support for WS-* andreliable messaging. At the same time, lona's ESB container technology, deployable only on application endpoints, retains backward compatibility with the vendor's Common Object Request Broker {CORBA)/fn[eniel hiler-ORB Protocol (ITOP) ORBs. Some SOA application plalform vendors (namely IBM. BEA. Oracle and Microsoft) see an opportunity to dominate the middleware market by embedding ESB functionality into their "application ciidpoints." therehy crowding out thirdpiuly middleware products {such as message brokers and integration hrokers) that operate from intermediary nodes in the network. However, it's not clear when or how other SOA platform vendors—. such as SAP and Novell—will add support for ESB message-exchange patterns.</p>
    <h2>Standards Reducing ESB Vendor Lock-in</h2>
    <p>ESB ilinctionality—across Windows, Java, Linux and other platforms—leverages the universal interoperability stack: WS-* set of industry standards and specifications. In recent years, SOA platform vendor support for the MOM-enabling WS-* standards has continued to grow, even though some of the relevant specifications have yet to achieve ratification from OASfS or other standards groups. Increasingly, all platform vendors will need to implement WS-RM in their architectures in order to enahle reliable, guaranteed, once-only delivery of SOAP messages over Web services environments. WS-Notification will become the liiii>iia franca of eventdriven middleware architectures. And WS-Transactions will support ACID and long-running transactions over a growing volume of SOAP traffic. It will take 1-2 years before WS-RM. WSNotification. and WS-Transactions jump several key hurdles, including widespread vendor implementation, published profiling by the Web Services Interoperabilily (WS-I) Organization, and conformance-group testing for multi-vendor interoperability. Until WS-RM and other ESB protocols are widely adopted, enterprises will continue to rely on traditional MOMs and other established middleware approaches to provide the end-to-end reliable messaging that the WS-* stack (in its current incomplete state) can't yet support. One consequence of this trend will be continuing reductions in vendor opportunities to lock customers in through proprietary specifications. Vendor- proprietary MOM application prograinming interfaces (APIs) have already taken a back seat to the common Java API—Java Message Service (JMS). In addition, all ESB vendors provide crossplatform APIs through the ability to wrap proprietary MOMs as Web services via WSDL and SOAP.</p>
    <h2>Major Platform And Middleware Vendors Will Dominate ESB Market</h2>
    <p>It's not clear which ESB vendors and platforms will survive the industry's cunent shakeout. Currently, the ESB market is experiencing a round of mergers and consolidations. The shakeout will continue for the foreseeable future, due both to overcrowding in the market and to tbe feveling forces of standardization and commoditization. One of the most significant recent mergers, in January 2(K)6, involved a pioneering ESB vendor— Sonic Software (an operating unit of Progress Software)—and one of the pioneering WSM vendors: Actional. Sonic clearly saw tbat WSM tools are critical for end-to-end management of ESBs. WSM provides application-layer tools for planning, optimizing, monitoring and managing ESB traffic flows and quality of service (QOS) throughout enterprise intranets, B2B supply chains and other integration environments. However, the merged Sonic/Actional won't be able to compete for long against the SOA platform vendors—especially IBM. BEA. Oracle and Microsoft^who are adding ESB and WSM functionality to their suites at a rapid clip. When the ESB market matures by the end of this decade. ESB pure-play vendors will find their value proposition usurped by platform vendors that have embedded ESB functionality into tbeir offerings. SOA application platform vendors—such as Microsoft, Oracle, IBM and BEA—are going to dominate the ESB space by the end of this decade. Many SOA platform vendors are embedding ESB functionality more deeply into their environments. They do so in order to address a broader range of integration scenarios, to support their own integration software products and to position their platforms as alternatives to tbird-party integration software. Clearly, Microsoft's WCF is a bold attempt to push ESB functionality more deeply into current and future versions of Windows. In the next 2-3 years, the ESB wave may give some platform vendors an advantage over their direct competitors. When Microsoft delivers commercial WCF—and Windows Workflow Foundation (WWF) functionality—in Vista and "Longborn." the company will be able to position its server and client platfonns as ESB-enabled out of the hox. Microsoft has also committed to runtiing WCF on pre-"Longhom" Windows platforms— Windows XP and Windows Server 2(X)3—which will further strengthen its ESB and SOA story. Over the next several years, platform vendors who fail to address ESB functionality in their road maps will marginalize themselves out of the SOA market. Minor platfonn vendors won't be able to survive in a market that will eventually be dominated by SOA platforms, ln order for SOA platform vendors—large and small—to distinguish their commoditized ESB features, they'll have to keep evolving up the functionality stack, adding WSM, dynamic content-based routing, distributed transactions, appliance form factors and other advanced features. As ESB functionality becomes ubiquitous in application pfatforms. pure-play ESB middleware vendors will struggle for survival. Today's ESB middleware market segment will fade away, absorbed into the SOA platforms that wifl dominate all distributed environments. ESB-enabled SOA platforms will dominate, and also accelerate the decline of today's separate ESB middleware market. The rest of this decade will see ongoing acquisitions, mergers and consolidations among platform and middleware vendors. In particular. Sonic, Tibco, Cape Clear. PolarLake and Fiorano, though currently positioned well in the ESB space, won't survive long unless they partner or merge with SOA platform vendors. As regards WSM functionality, there's little of that in today's ESB market—that's why tbe merger of Sonic (the ESB pioneer) and Actional (one of ihe WSM pioneers) is so significant. BEA is also a pioneer in merging ESB and WSM functionality, which it has been doing in its AquaLogic product family since 2005. Increasingly, ESB vendors will layer WSM functionality on their product architectures. It's very likely that other WSM pioneers, such as AmberPoint, will find suitors in the ESB space. Another likely development is that network appliance vendors—such as Cast Iron Systems, Cisco Systems, F5 Networks and Solace Systems— may reposition their products as high-performance ESB message processing nodes. It remains to be seen whether IBM will integrate appliance technology from DataPower—a WSM vendor that it recendy acquired—into its Web- Sphere BSB product. Another wild card is networking powerhouse Cisco, which has set its sights on the contentaware network appliance market under its Application- Oriented Networking (AON) strategy. For further infonnation on appliances, see "Exploring Content-Aware Network Appliances" in the December 2(X)5 issue of BCR (also BCR. July 2005, pp. 40-44).</p>
    <h2>ESB Will Deliver Its Own Blend Of Simplicity And Complexity</h2>
    <p>ESB is the paradigm du jour iti the middleware arena, promising the simplicity that comes from a unified, modular, flexible, visually-oriented integration environment. The ESB market is in danger of succumbing to the inflated expectations that grow out of incessant hype. Integration architects suffer from acronym fatigue, and many have tossed these three new letters onto the stack that includes SOA, BPM. EAI. MOM and other brijzht shiny marketing banners of yore. They don"t need more acronyms. What they need are integration products that are easy to install, configure, administer and manage. They need middleware Ihat suppotts robust, standardsbased, any-to-any integration. And they need to address new integration requirements cheaply and quickly, rather than in multi-year, high-risk, budget- busting mega-projects. Of course, today's ESB products can't deliver all of those benefits all the time. The problem is not so tnuch with ESB solutions themselves as with myriad legacy middleware products, protocols and approaches in most organizations. Companies have invested far too much tnoney on tniddleware. and on integrating applications via legacy middleware, to throw it all out overnight and start anew. Most real-world integration environments feature middleware products from several vendors, many of these implemented in the context of particular tactical projects, not as part of enterprise-wide architecture. ESB is a not a silver-bullet solution to the middleware mess. No single ESB product can provide a comprehensive solution to tbe di/.zying range of real-world integration requirements that confronts enterprises and service providers of any size and complexity. Most integration architects will choose to integrate diverse vendors' ESB components—both commercial and open source—rather than standardize on a single provider for this mission-critical backplane</p>
