<p><em>What are domain-specic designs?</em></p>
<p>"A Domain Specific Design Pattern is a set of objects and components that form a highly encapsulated, cohesive partition with clear boundaries, which can be used in a specific software domain. (Port, 1998)"</p>
<p><em>How does generic JSON collections work?</em></p>
<p>With a generic JSON collection, you have the GET, POST-to-Append, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, Pagination, and Search form actions available. GET will retrieve data. POST-to-Append will create a new item with POST. PUT is hew the state of an item should be updated. PATCH can be defined, but it is optional. DELETE has no actual defined responce to how to specifically respond to it, but the responce should match the HTTP standard for the item.</p>
<p><em>What is pagination?</em></p>
<p>Pagination is where there is more resource than what is reasonable to display. A predetermined number of records are displayed with a link to more sets. A typical display will have a way for the user to travel to previous sets if they have traversed into the list. RESTful Web APIs, by Leonard Richardson and Mike Amundsen state that IANA's generic link relations include next, previous, first, last, and pre to use with the rel attribute.</p>
